But at the same time, the emission spectrum of the Earth will be reduced as less energy will escape to space, and by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, this means the temperature will appear to be lower to an observer in space.\nSo how can the temperature of Earth be higher and lower at the same time?\nThe answer is that it cannot.\nThe IR leaving the surface is not actually \"blocked\" by CO2 et al. Instead it is redirected, and it is re-emitted along other IR wavelengths that are not \"blocked\", so that E in the equation below remains the same.\nThis is also required by the thermodynamic equilibrium condition, which means basically that the planet is always seeking a temperature at equilibrium where the incoming solar irradiation equals the outgoing Earth radiation the (E below).\nAssuming solar irradiation is constant for a moment, the only way, by the equation below, that the temperature can change is if the emissivity \u025b changes. \nBut, the role of CO2 is not presently quantified in the emissivity. This means that climate science, a relatively new science, is an immature field, essentially pre-science.\nIt is critical that we understand and precisely quantify how CO2 effects emissivity. Importantly, this quantitative model must include the effect of CO2 facilitating endothermic photosynthesis, which uses incoming solar photons and local thermal radiation to create plant and phytoplankton life at the basis of the food chain.\nThat's right, CO2 has a role in cooling the Earth, not just a potential role in warming it.\nIn addition, CO2 has a lower specific heat capacity than either N2 or O2, these latter which make up 99% of the atmosphere compared to CO2's 0.04%. This means that an atmosphere with higher CO2 concentration can hold less thermal energy at a given temperature, not more, and can thus melt less ice or warm ocean waters less (assuming they are warmed substantially at all).\nIn other words, it does not look good for CO2 as a gas that warms Earth (Mars, for instance, has an atmosphere with 95% CO2, and it is not warm)."}, {"id": 1663175919064829952, "username": "armandoalemany", "content": "@Snow65Snow @Travis_in_Flint Hahaha, lived through all of this \u2026damn, I\u2019m old.

By the time the tsunamis hit in previous periods of global warming, the temperatures in Antarctica were hotter than today's average by three degrees Celsius. Sea levels were also higher and ice sheets were smaller. This could mean that if climate change can be reversed, we may be able to avoid the prophesied tsunamis.\n\n\"Submarine landslides are a major geohazard with the potential to trigger tsunamis that can lead to huge loss of life,\" said Dr. Jenny Gales from the University of Plymouth. \"The landslides can also destroy infrastructure including subsea cables, meaning future such events would create a wide range of economic and social impacts.\"\n\nGales added that \"thanks to exceptional preservation of the sediments beneath the seafloor, we have for the first time been able to show what caused these historical landslides in this region of Antarctica and also indicate the impact of such events in the future.

But at the same time, the emission spectrum of the Earth will be reduced as less energy will escape to space, and by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, this means the temperature will appear to be lower to an observer in space.\nSo how can the temperature of Earth be higher and lower at the same time?\nThe answer is that it cannot.\nThe IR leaving the surface is not actually \"blocked\" by CO2 et al. Instead it is redirected, and it is re-emitted along other IR wavelengths that are not \"blocked\", so that E in the equation below remains the same.\nThis is also required by the thermodynamic equilibrium condition, which means basically that the planet is always seeking a temperature at equilibrium where the incoming solar irradiation equals the outgoing Earth radiation the (E below).\nAssuming solar irradiation is constant for a moment, the only way, by the equation below, that the temperature can change is if the emissivity \u025b changes. \nBut, the role of CO2 is not presently quantified in the emissivity. This means that climate science, a relatively new science, is an immature field, essentially pre-science.\nIt is critical that we understand and precisely quantify how CO2 effects emissivity. Importantly, this quantitative model must include the effect of CO2 facilitating endothermic photosynthesis, which uses incoming solar photons and local thermal radiation to create plant and phytoplankton life at the basis of the food chain.\nThat's right, CO2 has a role in cooling the Earth, not just a potential role in warming it.\nIn addition, CO2 has a lower specific heat capacity than either N2 or O2, these latter which make up 99% of the atmosphere compared to CO2's 0.04%. This means that an atmosphere with higher CO2 concentration can hold less thermal energy at a given temperature, not more, and can thus melt less ice or warm ocean waters less (assuming they are warmed substantially at all).\nIn other words, it does not look good for CO2 as a gas that warms Earth (Mars, for instance, has an atmosphere with 95% CO2, and it is not warm)."}, {"id": 1662875211765612545, "username": "SkipSkipking2", "content": "@ExtinctionR @Michael51525156 @carlsafina Extention, what ur compatriots have tried 2 do 2 recruit followers is unfathomable 2 say the least! u know exactly what they've done such as pictures of fires &amp; then thru innuendo try 2 make a connection w/the fires 2 fossil caused global warming, when the fires were human caused"}, {"id": 1662875169549893637, "username": "GeraldD93784384", "content": "Open borders.
