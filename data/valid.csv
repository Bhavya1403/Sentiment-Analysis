Scientists have found that almost any material can be used to turn the energy in the air's moisture into electricity,  which could lead to the continuous production of clean, low-pollution energy.
The research, published in a paper in Advanced Materials, builds on work in 2020 that first showed energy could be extracted from moisture in the air using material harvested from bacteria. The new study shows that almost any material can be used, such as wood or silicon, as long as it can be crushed into small particles and redesigned with microscopic pores. But there are many questions about how to scale up the product.

This discovery shows that it is possible to create an energy source from almost any material.
