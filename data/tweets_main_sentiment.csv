Despite the chaos and danger of the war, Mustafa's entire family, including his sons, managed to survive, and they were joyfully reunited after the conflict ended. The war in Kosovo involved the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), who controlled the region prior to the war, and the Kosovo Albanian rebel group known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The KLA fought against the Serbian persecution of Kosovo Albanians, while the FRY sought to maintain control over the area.

Lasting from 1998 to 1999, the war concluded with the intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), who conducted airstrikes that compelled the Yugoslav forces to withdraw from Kosovo. Both sides in the conflict committed war crimes and engaged in horrific acts of violence. The war was marred by ethnic tensions, issues of identity and independence, leading to a confusing and often misunderstood timeline.

Tragically, the war claimed the lives of 13,500 people and inflicted lasting pain by tearing families apart. The anguish and sorrow in Mustafa's eyes convey the depth of his experience.",negative

  ALPHA MALE SYNDROM, DYK:
Global warming: after passing CO2 levels of 350 ppm, humans began to evolve to a new updated species. CO2 levels were consistently around 280 ppm for almost 6,000 years of human civilization.  As well CO2 affects the brain...but here is a huge thought:

DID U KNOW in nature there is an anomaly called
ALPHA MALE SYNDROME?

New alpha regime go after the young of the entire previous group.
The premise is basically render that bloodline unable to breed, so a new bloodline becomes dominant.
When an old lead male dies the new alpha gets rid of the old groups young, not only because they want only their own bloodline to be dominant, but because it make the females stop mothering and lactating and go into mating mode.
It happens with a variety of species, especially those closest to humans, primates.
***
ONE last thought.
They have never found the crossover ""animal to human"" that caused the virus...a  virus  IN people... possibly engineered.

Right before the virus broke out there was an article on China having cloned pig/ monkey hybrids.

HAD gain of function furin techniques been used to heighten the Sars, using the hybrids, it would easily have jumped species...

And monkeys are top of the list of ALPHA MALE SYNDROME.
******
IF somehow genetic virus using monkeys can affect the behavior of people.... along with nature and evolution....

*
ALPHA MALE SYNDROME:

The institution of the alpha male is common to several species, including virtually all primates. At any given time, one male dominates the group, .. ..One of the first things that the new alpha does is to kill all the infants in the group, who are clearly the offspring of his predecessor.
  By terminating infants, he ends the lactation period of the females in the group, bringing their next ovulation cycle forward. This is based on the “genetic legacy” motivation;... Whatever the reason, there is a rich collection of primatological studies documenting such behaviour amongst gorillas, chimpanzees, baboons, langurs and others....
********

****************
CHINA 2019 CHIMERAS, right b4 virus
Pig and Macaque monkey hybrids successful embryo clone .

Scientists checked all known crossover ""animal to human"" possibilities, but never checked the chimeras, because who looks to find a virus crossover in an animal u do not know exists!

***
It is like a Cinderella hypothesis:
The Prince checked all females he knew about to fit the slipper, he at first missed Cinderella because she was hidden, he did not know she existed.

**
CHIMERA!

AND MONKEYS ARE TOP OF LIST TO ALPHA MALE SYNDROME SO IF SOMEHOW THAT MALE DNA GOT IN HUMANS AND BECAME DOMINANT...

IT WOULD BE LIKE PLANET OF THE APES BIOLOGY STYLE

(Hostile / aggressive towards females, over sexed, predatory at young, attempts at mating unwilling females)... see any of that anywhere ?

""No one has ever shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming, it's never been shown scientifically.""

""And if we look back in time, we've never had a correlation between temperature and carbon dioxide. There's never been climate change driven by carbon dioxide. All we see is the exact opposite. And the opposite is we've had six great ice ages, each of which kicked off when you had more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than now. So it's obvious: carbon dioxide does not and cannot drive global warming.""

It's not the climate that's ripping people's farms away; it's globalist sponsored climate totalitarians like John Kerry and Mark Rutte that pose the real existential threat to the farming industry. They are using the man-made global warming scam as a trojan horse to wipe out independent farmers, with the ultimate goal of establishing total central control of the global food supply.

They are using the man-made global warming scam as a trojan horse to wipe out independent farmers, with the ultimate goal of establishing total central control of the global food supply.

Scientists have found that almost any material can be used to turn the energy in the air's moisture into electricity,  which could lead to the continuous production of clean, low-pollution energy.
The research, published in a paper in Advanced Materials, builds on work in 2020 that first showed energy could be extracted from moisture in the air using material harvested from bacteria. The new study shows that almost any material can be used, such as wood or silicon, as long as it can be crushed into small particles and redesigned with microscopic pores. But there are many questions about how to scale up the product.

This discovery shows that it is possible to create an energy source from almost any material.

1656420128861437961,ClimSciJournal,"Why the Greenhouse Gas Theory is Invalid
As discussed before, if IR emissions from the Earth are absorbed by CO2, for example, then conservation of energy requires that the atmosphere's temperature rises. But at the same time, the emission spectrum of the Earth will be reduced as less energy will escape to space, and by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, this means the temperature will appear to be lower to an observer in space.
So how can the temperature of Earth be higher and lower at the same time?
The answer is that it cannot.
The IR leaving the surface is not actually ""blocked"" by CO2 et al. Instead it is redirected, and it is re-emitted along other IR wavelengths that are not ""blocked"", so that E in the equation below remains the same.
This is also required by the thermodynamic equilibrium condition, which means basically that the planet is always seeking a temperature at equilibrium where the incoming solar irradiation equals the outgoing Earth radiation the (E below).
Assuming solar irradiation is constant for a moment, the only way, by the equation below, that the temperature can change is if the emissivity ɛ changes. 
But, the role of CO2 is not presently quantified in the emissivity. This means that climate science, a relatively new science, is an immature field, essentially pre-science.
It is critical that we understand and precisely quantify how CO2 effects emissivity. Importantly, this quantitative model must include the effect of CO2 facilitating endothermic photosynthesis, which uses incoming solar photons and local thermal radiation to create plant and phytoplankton life at the basis of the food chain.
That's right, CO2 has a role in cooling the Earth, not just a potential role in warming it.
In addition, CO2 has a lower specific heat capacity than either N2 or O2, these latter which make up 99% of the atmosphere compared to CO2's 0.04%. This means that an atmosphere with higher CO2 concentration can hold less thermal energy at a given temperature, not more, and can thus melt less ice or warm ocean waters less (assuming they are warmed substantially at all).
In other words, it does not look good for CO2 as a gas that warms Earth (Mars, for instance, has an atmosphere with 95% CO2, and it is not warm).",neutral

1662918552527962118,thomas_retired,"Climate change may lead to massive tsunamis from Antarctica - study

A recent study found that massive tsunamis from Antarctica hit South America, New Zealand and Southeast Asia during two previous periods of global warming.

Climate change may lead to massive tsunamis from Antarctica, according to a study published last week in the peer-reviewed Nature Communications journal.

The study explained that the tsunamis would potentially be caused by submarine landslides - a phenomenon in which marine landslides push buildups of weak sediment into the open ocean, causing tsunamis.

The discovery was made after scientists drilled underwater in the ocean and found evidence that in previous periods of global warming three million and 15 million years ago, the same phenomenon sent massive tsunamis crashing into South America, New Zealand and Southeast Asia.

The danger may be reversible

The study notes that it may take time for these tsunamis to happen though. By the time the tsunamis hit in previous periods of global warming, the temperatures in Antarctica were hotter than today's average by three degrees Celsius. Sea levels were also higher and ice sheets were smaller. This could mean that if climate change can be reversed, we may be able to avoid the prophesied tsunamis.

""Submarine landslides are a major geohazard with the potential to trigger tsunamis that can lead to huge loss of life,"" said Dr. Jenny Gales from the University of Plymouth. ""The landslides can also destroy infrastructure including subsea cables, meaning future such events would create a wide range of economic and social impacts.""

Gales added that ""thanks to exceptional preservation of the sediments beneath the seafloor, we have for the first time been able to show what caused these historical landslides in this region of Antarctica and also indicate the impact of such events in the future. Our findings highlight how we urgently need to enhance our understanding of how global climate change might influence the stability of these regions and potential for future tsunamis.”

""Our findings highlight how we urgently need to enhance our understanding of how global climate change might influence the stability of these regions and potential for future tsunamis.”

Dr. Jenny Gales

""Giant submarine landslides have occurred both on southern and northern high latitude continental margins, including the Antarctic and Norwegian continental margins,"" said Jan Sverre Laberg from the Arctic University of Norway. ""More knowledge on these events in Antarctica will also be relevant for submarine geohazard evaluation offshore Norway.""

""This study illustrates the importance of scientific ocean drilling and marine geology for understanding both past climate change and identifying regions susceptible to natural hazards to inform infrastructure decisions,"" said Dr. Amelia Shevenell from Geological Oceanography at the University of Florida College of Marine Science.

CO2 does not ""block"" IR, it only redirects it.
",negative
1656420128861437961,ClimSciJournal,"Why the Greenhouse Gas Theory is Invalid
As discussed before, if IR emissions from the Earth are absorbed by CO2, for example, then conservation of energy requires that the atmosphere's temperature rises. But at the same time, the emission spectrum of the Earth will be reduced as less energy will escape to space, and by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, this means the temperature will appear to be lower to an observer in space.
So how can the temperature of Earth be higher and lower at the same time?
The answer is that it cannot.
The IR leaving the surface is not actually ""blocked"" by CO2 et al. Instead it is redirected, and it is re-emitted along other IR wavelengths that are not ""blocked"", so that E in the equation below remains the same.
This is also required by the thermodynamic equilibrium condition, which means basically that the planet is always seeking a temperature at equilibrium where the incoming solar irradiation equals the outgoing Earth radiation the (E below).
Assuming solar irradiation is constant for a moment, the only way, by the equation below, that the temperature can change is if the emissivity ɛ changes. 
But, the role of CO2 is not presently quantified in the emissivity. This means that climate science, a relatively new science, is an immature field, essentially pre-science.
It is critical that we understand and precisely quantify how CO2 effects emissivity. Importantly, this quantitative model must include the effect of CO2 facilitating endothermic photosynthesis, which uses incoming solar photons and local thermal radiation to create plant and phytoplankton life at the basis of the food chain.
That's right, CO2 has a role in cooling the Earth, not just a potential role in warming it.
In addition, CO2 has a lower specific heat capacity than either N2 or O2, these latter which make up 99% of the atmosphere compared to CO2's 0.04%. This means that an atmosphere with higher CO2 concentration can hold less thermal energy at a given temperature, not more, and can thus melt less ice or warm ocean waters less (assuming they are warmed substantially at all).
In other words, it does not look good for CO2 as a gas that warms Earth (Mars, for instance, has an atmosphere with 95% CO2, and it is not warm).",neutral
